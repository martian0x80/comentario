## What is Comentario? {#about}

Comentario is a powerful commenting tool for web pages. You can embed it in your website to allow your readers to add comments.

Enhance collaboration with your readers, collect useful feedback and engage in conversations. Say goodbye to boring plain posts and hello to well-organized, contextual comments directly on the page!
