The dynamic, or runtime, configuration of Comentario server can be set in the Administrative UI.

<!--more-->

As opposed to the [static config](static), which can only be changed on server start-up, dynamic items can be changed on-the-fly, and they apply immediately.

These items include options such as:

* Enable images in comments,
* Enable links in comments,
* Require email address confirmation for commenters,

and others.

In order to view or edit the dynamic configuration, open the Administrative UI and navigate to `Administration` → `Configuration` → `Dynamic`.

Any changes will be saved in the database and apply right away.
