description: How to get started using Comentario
---

If you just want to see Comentario in action, you can navigate to our [demo page](https://demo.comentario.app).

<p>
{{< button "https://demo.comentario.app" `View Demo<i class="fas fa-external-link ms-2"></i>` "primary" "BFOR" >}}
</p>

If you're interested in using Comentario, you have the following options:

## Cloud version

This option is currently not available because Comentario is quite young; we expect a cloud version to arrive at a later moment. Please stay tuned!
