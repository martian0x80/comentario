[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a modern, production-grade cloud deployment system developed by Google.

Kubernetes provides numerous tools for reliable, scalable cloud deployments, but its flexibility may well prove overwhelming, especially when it comes to deploying multiple components.

Comentario addresses that complexity by providing a so-called [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart, which greatly facilitates server deployment in a cloud environment.

The chart is available in [Comentario git repository](/about/source-code) in the `helm/comentario` directory.
