## What is Comentario? {#features}

Comentario is a platform that you can embed in your website to allow your readers to add comments. It's lightweight and fast.

### Features

Comentario supports the Markdown syntax and can do a lot for you:

* Import from Disqus
* Comment voting
* Automated spam detection
* Moderation tools
* Sticky comments
* Thread locking
* OAuth login
* Single sign-on
* Email notifications

### Installation

At this moment, Comentario only supports on-premises installs: you have to self-host it.

Comentario can easily be added on any web page by including a tiny HTML snippet (generated for you by your Comentario instance), similar to this:

```html
<script defer src="https://example.com/js/comentario.js"></script>
<div id="comentario"></div>
```

Comentario is [open-source software](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario) distributed on the terms of the MIT license.
