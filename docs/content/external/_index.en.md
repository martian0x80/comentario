## What is Comentario? {#about}

Comentario is a powerful commenting tool for web pages. You can embed it in your website to allow your readers to add comments.

Enhance collaboration with your readers, collect useful feedback and engage in conversations. Say goodbye to boring plain posts and hello to well-organized, contextual comments directly on the page!

## Why Comentario? {#why}

Comentario is a free and lightweight alternative to services such as Disqus, Jetpack, and Facebook Comments.

The web comment module is **privacy-focused** and has a **tiny footprint**: ~17 KB gzipped! 

## Features {#features}

Comentario supports the Markdown syntax and can do a lot for you:

* Modern, mobile-first design
* Nested, editable comments and replies
* Custom avatars
* Import from Disqus
* Comment voting
* Automated spam detection
* Moderation tools
* Sticky comments
* Thread locking
* OAuth login
* Single sign-on
* Email notifications

## Installation {#install}

At this moment, Comentario only supports on-premises installs: you have to self-host it.

Comentario can easily be added on any web page by including a tiny HTML snippet (generated for you by your Comentario instance), similar to this:

```html
<script defer src="https://example.com/js/comentario.js"></script>
<div id="comentario"></div>
```

Please refer to the [README](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario/-/blob/master/README.md) to learn how to install it.
