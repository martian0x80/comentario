From the end-user perspective, Comentario consists of two parts: the **embedded comment engine** and the **Administration UI** (we also call it the frontend). 

## Embedded comments

Comentario's embedded comment engine allows to render a comment thread (tree), and each page it's embedded on has its own comment tree.

* The term *comment tree* means that comments are organized in a tree structure, so that comments can have children â€” which we call **replies**. Child comments can also be *collapsed* with a button.
* Comment text can be formatted using the [Markdown syntax](/kb/markdown): you can make words **bold**, insert images and links, and so on.
* Comment thread uses mobile-first responsive design, which looks great on all devices.
* Comments can be edited and deleted.
* Other users can vote on comments they like or dislike. Voting is reflected in the comment **score**.
